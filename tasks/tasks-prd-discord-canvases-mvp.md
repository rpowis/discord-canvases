# Tasks: Discord Canvases MVP Implementation

Based on the PRD analysis, here are the detailed tasks required to implement the Discord Canvases feature:

## Relevant Files

- `src/models/Canvas.js` - Canvas data model and CRUD operations
- `src/models/Canvas.test.js` - Unit tests for Canvas model
- `src/models/EditSession.js` - Edit session management and locking logic
- `src/models/EditSession.test.js` - Unit tests for edit session functionality
- `src/storage/database.js` - Database connection and initialization (SQLite)
- `src/storage/database.test.js` - Unit tests for database operations
- `src/commands/canvasCommands.js` - Canvas creation and management commands
- `src/commands/canvasCommands.test.js` - Unit tests for canvas command logic
- `src/ui/embeds.js` - Discord embed generation for canvas display
- `src/ui/embeds.test.js` - Unit tests for embed formatting
- `src/ui/modals.js` - Modal creation for canvas editing and title input
- `src/ui/modals.test.js` - Unit tests for modal components
- `src/ui/buttons.js` - Button component creation and management
- `src/ui/buttons.test.js` - Unit tests for button interactions
- `src/utils/markdown.js` - Markdown parsing and validation utilities
- `src/utils/markdown.test.js` - Unit tests for markdown functionality
- `src/utils/validation.js` - Input validation helpers (title, content length)
- `src/utils/validation.test.js` - Unit tests for validation functions
- `config/config.js` - Bot configuration and environment variables (CREATED)
- `package.json` - Project dependencies, scripts, and Jest configuration (CREATED)
- `env.example` - Environment variable template (CREATED)
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore file for sensitive files and artifacts (CREATED)
- `README.md` - Project setup and usage instructions

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `Canvas.js` and `Canvas.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` or `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The bot requires a Discord Application Token stored in environment variables.
